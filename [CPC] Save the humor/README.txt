## THE PLOT
##################

It is the end of 2014 and something extrange is happening: almost
no one can smile or laugh. There is something bizarre in the aire, 
something that is absorving the humor from the people. 

You are Charlie, a happy scientist that has been most of his live
carrying out some research on joke-science. Your knowledge of 
thousands of jokes is critical for saving the humor. A college 
visits you and shows what is happenning exactly. Centuries ago,
at the very start of the Roman empire, some aliens were studying
humans. Those aliens were very peculiar: they did not have sense 
of humor at all. Therefore, they were so curious about humor, that
they decided to construct a tecnology able to collect the humor
from its surroundings. 

Once the Aliens had their machine ready, they thought that it would
take centuries to collect all the humor from the earth, and they 
were not willing to stay for so long. So, they proposed a deal to
the emperor and their court: they will give new weapons that will 
make the Roman empire stronger and, in return, the Roman empire will
grow to protect the humor collecting machine from any kind of 
menace, until its work is finished. The emperor agreed and then he himself 
and his army were the first to be drained out of humor and they 
got stronger muscles and weapons in return.

Your mision is to get a time machine and return to the start of the
Roman Empire to destroy the humor-collecting machine before it can
start making its harm to the humanity. You will have to tell 
good jokes to Romans in order to make them laugh and destroy their
humorless status and, finally, you will have to destroy de machine.

Good Luck, Charlie!


## HOW TO COMPILE
##################

This game uses a modification of the CPCITOR framework to build a .DSK 
for Amstrad CPCfile from sources. For building it you need to do the
following steps

* Under Windows:
------------------------------
*1 Install Cygwin on your system if you do not have it already installed
** Note: for this, a 32bits version of cygwin has been used

*2 Unpack the ZIP file just below your $HOME directory 
*** This will create a $HOME/$GAME folder

*3 Ensure that you have these files UNDER the $HOME/$GAME/tool folder (2)
*** HEX2BIN 1.0.10: 
**** hex2bin/Hex2bin-1.0.10/hex2bin.exe
*** IDSK      0.13: 
**** idsk/iDSK.0.13/iDSK/src
*** SDCC     3.4.0: 
**** sdcc/sdcc-3.4.0.installtree/bin/sdasz80.exe
**** sdcc/sdcc-3.4.0.installtree/bin/sdcc.exe
**** sdcc/sdcc-3.4.0.installtree/bin/sdcpp.exe
**** sdcc/sdcc-3.4.0.installtree/bin/sdldz80.exe
**** sdcc/sdcc-3.4.0.installtree/share/sdcc/lib/z80/z80.lib

*4 Enter into $HOME/$GAME through your cygwin console

*5 Typein "make"

(2) These files may not have been distributed to you along with the ZIP file: 
    they are external tools whose rights belong solely to their authors.
    You may download them by downloading HEX2BIN, IDSK and SDCC packs from
    the Internet. You may need to compile some of them from sources. If you
    want to get them fast, you may want to have a look to CPCITOR framework,
    which would get all of them for you
